#Pyongyang#

I'm the evil **[Theme Joker](http://twitter.com/themejoker/)!** I'm here to corrupt the world, one theme a time!

This is my first Wordpress theme, **Pyongyang**. Inspired by the [Korean News](http://kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm) website, this theme pays my respects to the Surpreme Leader, by allowing others to follow in his golden path.
